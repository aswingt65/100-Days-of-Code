# 100 Days Coding Challenge
I'm publicly committing to the 100DaysOfCode Challenge starting today! 
Solving 1 problem a day other than the problem of the day in geeksforgeeks.

## Day 1 [10/09/2023]
<b>Problem :</b> Remove duplicate elements from sorted Array<br>
<b>Statement :</b> Given a sorted array A[] of size N, delete all the duplicated elements from A[]. Modify the array such that if there are X distinct elements in it then the first X positions of the array should be filled with them in increasing order and return the number of distinct elements in the array.<br>

## Day 2 [11/09/2023]
<b>Problem :</b> First Repeating Element<br>
<b>Statement :</b> Given an array arr[] of size n, find the first repeating element. The element should occur more than once and the index of its first occurrence should be the smallest.<br>
Note:- The position you return should be according to 1-based indexing. <br>

## Day 4 [13/09/2023]
<b>Problem :</b> Wave Array<br>
<b>Statement :</b> Given a sorted array arr[] of distinct integers. Sort the array into a wave-like array(In Place).
In other words, arrange the elements into a sequence such that arr[1] >= arr[2] <= arr[3] >= arr[4] <= arr[5].....<br>
If there are multiple solutions, find the lexicographically smallest one. <br>

## Day 7 [16/09/2023]
<b>Problem :</b> Union of Two Sorted Arrays<br>
<b>Statement :</b> Union of two arrays can be defined as the common and distinct elements in the two arrays.
Given two sorted arrays of size n and m respectively, find their union. <br>
