# 100 Days Coding Challenge
I'm publicly committing to the 100DaysOfCode Challenge starting today! 
Solving 1 problem a day other than the problem of the day in geeksforgeeks.

## Day 1 [10/09/2023]

<b>Statement :</b> Given a sorted array A[] of size N, delete all the duplicated elements from A[]. Modify the array such that if there are X distinct elements in it then the first X positions of the array should be filled with them in increasing order and return the number of distinct elements in the array.<br>
